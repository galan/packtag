               - The setting "cache.servlet.path" is now obsolete, and has no meaning any longer 
               - Please update your url-mapping in the web.xml to "*.pack"
               - Update the packtag.tld file
               - Please note that the attribute "compress" is renamed to "minify",
                 because the term "compress" is ambiguous.

    be created (one that isn't stored in your VS) for user-defined settings (eg. to disable minification during development).
